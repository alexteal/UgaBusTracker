#UgaBusTracker

## A static based bus tracker for UGA buses on the Health Sciences route

This site is more designed as a "leave on a tv" sort of site. 
For me, I have it on an old phone showing the arrival time for the nearest bus. 

## Reverse Engineering REST API

I tried building a version of the site using pure js, but unfortunately CORS errors prevent requesting the API from an external site.
